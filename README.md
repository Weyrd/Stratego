# Stratego Game

![Stratego Game](stratego.png)

Stratego Game is a school project developed within a 3-day timeframe to learn Node.js, Express, Sessions, and MySQL. The project aims to create an online version of the popular board game Stratego.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- Express: A web application framework for Node.js.
- Socket.io: A library for real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between the browser and the server.
- MySQL: A relational database management system for storing game data.

## Development

The project follows a client-server architecture, with the backend implemented in Node.js and Express. The client-side interactions are handled using Socket.io for real-time communication. MySQL is used to store and retrieve game-related data such as player moves and game states.

The project was developed as a school project to learn and practice the fundamentals of Node.js, Express, and sessions within a limited time frame. As a result, the codebase may not be optimized for production-level environments.

## Installation

To run the Stratego Game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/stratego-game.git`
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
3. Set up the MySQL database and update the database configuration in the `config.js` file.
4. Start the server by running `npm start` or `node server.js`.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
6. Enjoy playing the Stratego Game!
